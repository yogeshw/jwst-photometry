# Scientific Validation

This directory holds notebooks, scripts, and reference data for Phase 8 scientific validation:

- HST comparison checks
- Theoretical prediction consistency
- Cross-validation with other JWST photometry tools
- Systematic error characterization
- Completeness and reliability assessments

Place benchmark catalogs and small cutout images here (or symlink) for reproducible tests.
